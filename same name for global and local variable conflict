A variable can't be both local and global inside a function. 
So Python decides that we want a local variable due to the assignment to s inside f(), 
so the first print statement before the definition of s throws the error message above. 
Any variable which is changed or created inside a function is local, if it hasn't been declared as a global variable. 
To tell Python, that we want to use the global variable, we have to explicitly state this by using the keyword "global", as can be seen in the following example:

def f():
    global s
    print(s)
    s = "Only in spring, but London is great as well!"
    print(s)


s = "I am looking for a course in Paris!" 
f()
print(s)
I am looking for a course in Paris!
Only in spring, but London is great as well!
Only in spring, but London is great as well!
